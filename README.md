## Format
The workshop is designed as a one-day experience with a mix of presentations and quite a lot of demos.

To make it more enjoyable for everyone, we are going to implement a multiplayer game (Pac-Man / FatCat inspired) with an already existing JavaScript client and a server part, written with Quarkus. 

Have a look at [GitHub](https://github.com/wpernath/quarkus-grumpycat) to see a demo of the game.
